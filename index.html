        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</li>
            <p>I helped create a working website for my software engineering class that was essentially a recipe database with varying capabilities.</p>
            <li>What do you hope to learn from this class?</li>
            <p>I hope to feel confident in understanding the foundations of web development. I want to be able to create at least a basic website solely from remembering the knowledge I have gained.
                <br>I also want to learn how to research and use my resources, through people or on the internet, in order to create more advanced projects and have the opportunity to "level up" a website.</b>
                <br>Finally, I want to broaden my base enough so that I can be a good asset to my future teams.</b> 
            </p>
            <li>Have you signed up for our course Piazza forum?</li>
            <p>My understanding is that we are using Campuswire for communications. I have signed up for the course on Campuswire.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Random Story Time</h2>
        <p>On a flight to Dubai, I accidently took too much dramamine for motion sickness and when I got up to use the facilites, I passed out at the foot of a stranger. I came to with an oxygen mask over my face and the flight attendents moved me into first class where I got to lay down in, essentially, a private egg. They brought me the first class meals and a lot of king sized candy bars. There was still about 12 hours left in the flight. I had never flown first class before and it was an epic conclusion to an unfortunate situation. </p>
