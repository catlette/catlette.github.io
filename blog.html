        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment.  How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>I had challenges publishing my pages initally. I haven't accessed my personal ENGR web space yet. In order to move forward from this, I followed the link provided in the README.md file of assignment 1. Going through this helped me accomplish the task.</p>
            <li>What did you learn from this assignment?  What did you already know?</li>
            <p>I learned how to publish something on my personal ENGR page through OSU. I already had a rudamentary knowledge of html from a previous class so creating these initial assignments did not prove a challenge.</p>
            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?  How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>The links I mentioned for the above question were a helpful resource to use. I also checked the class Campuswire forum just to look through and see where other people were at/if I could provide assistance to anyone.</p>
        </ul>
